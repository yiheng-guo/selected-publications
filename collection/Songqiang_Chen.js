        "abstract": "The Language Server Protocol (LSP) has revolutionized the integration of code intelligence in modern software development. There are approximately 300 LSP server implementations for various languages and 50 editors offering LSP integration. However, the reliability of LSP servers is a growing concern, as crashes can disable all code intelligence features and significantly impact productivity, while vulnerabilities can put developers at risk even when editing untrusted source code. Despite the widespread adoption of LSP, no existing techniques specifically target LSP server testing. To bridge this gap, we present LspFuzz, a grey-box hybrid fuzzer for systematic LSP server testing. Our key insight is that effective LSP server testing requires holistic mutation of source code and editor operations, as bugs often manifest from their combinations. To satisfy the sophisticated constraints of LSP and effectively explore the input space, we employ a two-stage mutation pipeline: syntax-aware mutations to source code, followed by context-aware dispatching of editor operations. We evaluated LspFuzz on four widely used LSP servers. LspFuzz demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline fuzzers, and uncovered previously unknown bugs in real-world LSP servers. Of the 51 bugs we reported, 42 have been confirmed, 26 have been fixed by developers, and two have been assigned CVE numbers. Our work advances the quality assurance of LSP servers, providing both a practical tool and foundational insights for future research in this domain.",

        "abstract": "Failure indexing is a longstanding crux in software debugging, the goal of which is to automatically divide failures (e.g., failed test cases) into distinct groups according to the culprit root causes, as such multiple faults residing in a faulty program can be handled independently and simultaneously. The community of failure indexing has long been plagued by two challenges: (1) The effectiveness of division is still far from promising. Specifically, existing failure indexing techniques only employ a limited source of software runtime data, for example, code coverage, to be failure proximity and further divide them, which typically delivers unsatisfactory results. (2) The outcome can be hardly comprehensible. Specifically, a developer who receives the division result is just aware of how all failures are divided, without knowing why they should be divided the way they are. This leads to difficulties for developers to be convinced by the division result, which in turn affects the adoption of the results. To tackle these two problems, in this article, we propose SURE , a vi SU alized failu R e ind E xing approach using the program memory spectrum (PMS). We first collect the runtime memory information (i.e., variables’ names and values, as well as the depth of the stack frame) at several preset breakpoints during the execution of a failed test case, and transform the gathered memory information into a human-friendly image (called PMS). Then, any pair of PMS images that serve as proxies for two failures is fed to a trained Siamese convolutional neural network, to predict the likelihood of them being triggered by the same fault. Last, a clustering algorithm is adopted to divide all failures based on the mentioned likelihood. In the experiments, we use 30% of the simulated faults to train the neural network, and use 70% of the simulated faults as well as real-world faults to test. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SURE: It achieves 101.20% and 41.38% improvements in faults number estimation, as well as 105.20% and 35.53% improvements in clustering, compared with the state-of-the-art technique in this field, in simulated and real-world environments, respectively. Moreover, we carry out a human study to quantitatively evaluate the comprehensibility of PMS, revealing that this novel type of representation can help developers better comprehend failure indexing results.",

        "abstract": "The Image Captioning (IC) technique is widely used to describe images in natural language. However, even state-of-the-art IC systems can still produce incorrect captions and lead to misunderstandings. Recently, some IC system testing methods have been proposed. However, these methods still rely on pre-annotated information and hence cannot really alleviate the difficulty in identifying the test oracle. Furthermore, their methods artificially manipulate objects, which may generate unreal images as test cases and thus lead to less meaningful testing results. Thirdly, existing methods have various requirements on the eligibility of source test cases, and hence cannot fully utilize the given images to perform testing. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReIC</small> to perform metamorphic testing for the IC systems with some image-level reduction transformations like image cropping and stretching. Instead of relying on the pre-annotated information, <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReIC</small> uses a localization method to align objects in the caption with corresponding objects in the image, and checks whether each object is correctly described or deleted in the caption after transformation. With the image-level reduction transformations, <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReIC</small> does not artificially manipulate any objects and hence can avoid generating unreal follow-up images. Additionally, it eliminates the requirement on the eligibility of source test cases during the metamorphic transformation process, as well as decreases the ambiguity and boosts the diversity among the follow-up test cases, which consequently enables testing to be performed on any test image and reveals more distinct valid violations. We employ <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReIC</small> to test five popular IC systems. The results demonstrate that <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ReIC</small> can sufficiently leverage the provided test images to generate follow-up cases of good realism, and effectively detect a great number of distinct violations, without the need for any pre-annotated information.",

        "abstract": "Question Answering (QA) is an attractive and challenging area in NLP community. With the development of QA technique, plenty of QA software has been applied in daily human life to provide convenient access of information retrieval. To investigate the performance of QA software, many benchmark datasets have been constructed to provide various test cases. However, current QA software is mainly tested in a reference-based paradigm, in which the expected outputs (labels) of test cases are mandatory to be annotated with much human effort before testing. As a result, neither the just-in-time test during usage nor the extensible test on massive unlabeled real-life data is feasible, which keeps the current testing of QA software from being flexible and sufficient. In this work, we propose a novel testing method, qaAskeR $$^+$$ + , with five new Metamorphic Relations for QA software. qaAskeR $$^+$$ + does not refer to the annotated labels of test cases. Instead, based on the idea that a correct answer should imply a piece of reliable knowledge that always conforms with any other correct answer, qaAskeR $$^+$$ + tests QA software by inspecting its behaviors on multiple recursively asked questions that are relevant to the same or some further enriched knowledge. Experimental results show that qaAskeR $$^+$$ + can reveal quite a few violations that indicate actual answering issues on various mainstream QA software without using any pre-annotated labels.",

        "abstract": "With the great progress in deep learning and natural language processing, many completion tools are proposed to help practitioners efficiently fill in various fields in software document. However, most of these tools offer their users only one option and this option generally requires much revision to meet a satisfactory quality, which hurts much practicality of the completion tools. By finding that the beam search model of such tools often generates a much better output at relatively high confidence and considering the interactive use of such tools, we advise such tools to offer multiple high-confidence model outputs for more chances of offering a good option. And we further suggest these tools offer dissimilar outputs to expand the chance of including a better output in a few options. To evaluate our whole idea, we design a clustering-based initial method to help these tools properly offer some dissimilar model outputs as options. We adopt this method to improve nine completion tools for three software document fields. Results show it can help all the nine tools offer an option that needs less revision from users and thus effectively improve the practicality of tools.",

In practice, it is very common that an issue has multiple labels. However, current works are mainly based on single-label prediction, which are not suitable for just-in-time multi-labeling services, due to the low efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MULA, a just-in-time MUlti-LAbeling system, which learns and automatically assigns multiple labels to issue reports. We have built a dataset with 81,601 entries and 11 labels, as the first benchmark for this task, and implemented a GitHub app. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work and tool for online multi-labeling GitHub issues based on their categories. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study, including comparisons with five commonly adopted labeling models that show the superiority of MULA, as well as an evaluation that shows high consistency between MULA’s suggestions and developers’ opinions.",

        "abstract": "Due to the wide use of visual perception techniques in safety-critical fields, existing studies have tested the robustness of the essential object detection systems in scenarios with different image content. However, the applications that perceive one video with multiple image frames, such as autonomous driving, usually further require the trajectories of objects. This is mainly realized by combining detecting objects and associating detected objects in frames using multiple object tracking (MOT) systems. Thus, it is also essential to test the robustness of MOT systems, particularly in their exclusive scenarios that involve variety beyond the static image content. In this paper, we propose a novel testing method with five new Metamorphic Relations to realize the robustness test for MOT systems in two typical categories of scenarios, i.e., the speed variety of tracked objects and temporary camera failures. Our method also properly addresses the oracle problem and the lack of test cases for some rare scenarios to make the test efficient and diverse. Finally, we use our method to test three typical MOT systems and effectively reveal numerous and diverse MOT errors. We also extensively discuss the performance of tested systems and summarize two typical scenes where they often misbehave.",

        "abstract": "Traditional online map tiles, which are widely used on the Internet, such as by Google Maps and Baidu Maps, are rendered from vector data. The timely updating of online map tiles from vector data, for which generation is time-consuming, is a difficult mission. Generating map tiles over time from remote sensing images is relatively simple and can be performed quickly without vector data. However, this approach used to be challenging or even impossible. Inspired by image-to-image translation (img2img) techniques based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), we proposed a semisupervised generation of styled map tiles based on the GANs (SMAPGAN) model to generate styled map tiles directly from remote sensing images. In this model, we designed a semisupervised learning strategy to pretrain SMAPGAN on rich unpaired samples and fine-tune it on limited paired samples in reality. We also designed the image gradient L1 loss and the image gradient structure loss to generate a styled map tile with global topological relationships and detailed edge curves for objects, which are important in cartography. Moreover, we proposed the edge structural similarity index (ESSI) as a metric to evaluate the quality of the topological consistency between the generated map tiles and ground truth. The experimental results show that SMAPGAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) works according to the mean squared error, the structural similarity index, and the ESSI. Also, SMAPGAN gained higher approval than SOTA in a human perceptual test on the visual realism of cartography. Our work shows that SMAPGAN is a new tool with excellent potential for producing styled map tiles. Our implementation of SMAPGAN is available at https://github.com/imcsq/SMAPGAN.",

        "abstract": "Exception handling is an effective mechanism to guarantee software reliability in modern programming languages. An exception interrupts the program execution and propagates backwards along the call chain until the exception is caught by an exception handler. In software development practices, developers may be confused in determining where to place the exception handler in the call chain. The reason is that exception handling requires a developer to take a comprehensive consideration from a global perspective of the software project. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach EHAdvisor, which recommends exception handling locations from the global perspective of the project. EHAdvisor first trains a binary classification model based on four types of features, including architectural features, project features, functional features, and exception features. Then, for a new code snippet with exceptions, EHAdvisor predicts the exception catching probability for each method in the call chain based on the classification model and recommends Top-K exception handling locations based on the probability ranking. We conducted experiments on a dataset from 29 high-quality open source projects. Experimental results show that EHAdvisor achieves an average Top-1 recommendation success rate of 70.83% for across-project location recommendation and an average Top-1 accuracy of 86.21% for intra-project recommendation. Experiments on the importance scores show that global features, such as project features and architectural features, are evidently important to the recommendation of exception handling locations.",

As a result, neither the just-in-time test during usage nor the extensible test on massive unlabeled real-life data is feasible, which keeps the current testing of QA software from being flexible and sufficient. In this paper, we propose a method, qaAskeR, with three novel Metamorphic Relations for testing QA software. qaAskeR does not require the annotated labels but tests QA software by checking its behaviors on multiple recursively asked questions that are related to the same knowledge. Experimental results show that qaAskeR can reveal violations at over 80% of valid cases without using any preannotated labels. Diverse answering issues, especially the limited generalization on question types across datasets, are revealed on a state-of-the-art QA algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging for sentences is a basic and widely-used Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique. People rely heavily on it to predict POS tags that serve as the base for many advanced NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, word sense disambiguation, and information retrieval. However, POS tagging tools could make wrong predictions, which bring consequent error propagation to the advanced tasks and even cause serious threats in critical application domains. In this paper, we propose to test POS tagging tools with Metamorphic Testing against some properties that they should follow. The preliminary exploration with two groups of Metamorphic Relations shows that our method can effectively reveal defects of three common POS tagging tools (i.e., spaCy, NLTK, and Flair) on handling fairly simple intra- and inter-sentence transformation regarding adverbial clause and sentence appending. This demonstrates the great potential of our method to deliver a systematic test and reveal the unaware issues, which may benefit the validation, repair, and improvement, for POS tagging tools.",
